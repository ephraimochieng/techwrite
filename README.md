**Syntax and Markdown Elements:**

* **Headers**: Use hash signs (`#`) to create headers. The number of hashes indicates the header level. For example, `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.

* **Lists**: Create bullet lists with asterisks (`*`) or hyphens (`-`). For numbered lists, use numbers followed by periods.

* **Code Blocks**: Enclose code snippets with three backticks (````) before and after the code. You can specify the programming language after the first set of backticks to enable syntax highlighting.

* **Links**: Use the `[text](URL)` format to create links.

* **Bold and Italics**: Use double asterisks (`**`) for bold and single asterisks (`*`) for italics.

* **Tables**: While not part of standard Markdown, GitHub flavored Markdown allows tables with a syntax like this:

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|---------|----------|
| Content | Content  |
```

* **Fenced Code Blocks**: For blocks of code, you can use triple backticks followed by the programming language name:


```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
